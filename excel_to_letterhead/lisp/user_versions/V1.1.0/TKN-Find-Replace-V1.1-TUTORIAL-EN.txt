1 - Open the LSP file called "TKN-Find-Replace-V1.LSP"

2 - Set all the variables under "INPUT" section
	csv_file 	:The directory where the table is located.
	project_code 	:The project code. This variable is used to check if the table rows contain valid information when getting the project names from the table.
	import_path 	:The directory with all files to be processed.
	export_path 	:The directory where the processed files will be exported.

3 - Open one of the DWG files to be processed.

4 - Write "APPLOAD" to the prompt interface.     

5 - Select the LSP file ("TKN-Find-Replace-V1.LSP") and click load. You can either click "Always Load" or "Load Once".

6 - Write "TKN-FIND-REPLACE" to call the function

7 - Select the directory of the files to be processed.

8 - You can monitor the process by looking at the "export" directory you have specified.                                                 

IMPORTANT NOTES:

***AFTER SAVING THE EXCEL FILE AS CSV, DO NOT OPEN THE CSV FILE WITH EXCEL ANY MORE. BECAUSE IT CONVERTS STRINGS LIKE "00" TO SINGLE LETTER NUMBERS. IF YOU NEED TO OPEN THE FILE, OPEN WITH NOTEPAD OR ANY OTHER PROGRAM THAT DOES NOT INTERVENE WITH THE CELLS.

***DON'T FORGET TO USE QUOTE (") WHILE SETTING THE VARIABLES.
	WRONG CASE: 	C:/TKN/DATA/Table.csv
	CORRECT CASE: 	"C:/TKN/DATA/Table.csv"

***USE "/" INSTEAD OF "\" WHILE SETTING THE DIRECTORY VARIABLES. OTHERWISE THE CODE WON'T WORK.
	WRONG CASE:	"C:\TKN\DATA\Table.csv"
	CORRECT CASE:	"C:/TKN/DATA/Table.csv"

***PUT "/" END OF THE IMPORT AND EXPORT PATHS. 
	WRONG CASE: 	"C:/TKN/DATA"
	CORRECT CASE: 	"C:/TKN/DATA/"
